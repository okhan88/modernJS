TUTORIAL 2:

variables help store values and then use that value later

    you can use "let"
    "const" is used when you never want the variable to change

you can not use spaces in the variables
variables can not start with a number

Javascript data types

    Number: 1,2,3, 100, 3.14
    String- series of characters in quotes: "hello, world" 
    Boolean- true or false value, not in quotes and not in strings
    Null- explicityl set a variable with no value
    undefined- for variables that have not yet been defined
    object- complex data structures, some types are arrays, dates, literals, etc
    symbol- used with objects


strings store letters, numbers, characters, sentences, etc

TUTORIAL 3:

Control Flow

a loop is used for cycling through data

{} this is a block to keep code in

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {}
    (let i = 0) is like a counter. counts how many times we cycle through the loop
    (i < 5) is a condition
    (i++) is the final expression


each iteration is one cycle through the data

for while loops
    set up is different than while loops
